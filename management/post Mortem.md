| Team Member      | Mad                                                                                                                  |Glad                                                                                 | Overwiew of Him/Her by the Team                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Alexis SANTOS    | After finishing my fucntional I didn't know what to do and I just waited Lucas task help.                            |      Happy to deliver my functional in time.                                              | Work a lot and the type of person we want on a team. Maybe take a little to much a project and his role at huge stake.                                                                                                                      |
| Loïc NOGUES      | I didn't know what to do when Alexis finish his main task and what do give him.                                      |      First time manager and happy to deliver something that is not insane but quiet good. | Not a well experienced manager but a good transition between serious and not serious. He did only his role in heart  but not ohter task like code etc. He asked question about his role.                                                    |
| Grégory PAGNOUX  | /                                                                                                                        | Happy of the work that I deliver.                                                    | Good worker but he is to much in his buble. He have his method of work and will always find work.                                                                                                                                           |
| Lucas MEGNAN     | I didn't manage to do what I needed to do and ask for help to late.                                                  |      We got some good ideas but not always implemented.                                   | He did his work because we have a result. Good vibes but grumpy at some time. Waiting for Yann-Mael to generate AI code parts. Didn't try to search by himself. Bad comment and speak in other's back. Cutting people of because of an ego. |
| Yann-Maël BOUTON | Was not happy about not working that much on the project because the project and other things gave me no motivation. |      /                                                                                    | Good vibes, a good element but can be distracted a lot. A bit too grumpy. Not motivated, just did his technical.                                                                                                                            |
| Mathis LEBEL     | I didn't work that much and that can penalised the team. Its because I didn't want to.                                  | I did what I needed to do.                                                           | Good vibes but disctrated. Didn't care about the project. Not always a good work. No motivation about his work.                                                                                                                             |


## Total of project time for each team members
|Team members| Overtime | Absent | Project time | Total |
| ------- | ------ |-----|------|-----|
|Alexis|16h30|0h|46h30|63h|
|Loïc|7h|0h30|45h30|52h30|
|Yann-Maël|4h|7h|39h|43h|
|Lucas|3h|3h|43h|46h|
|Mathis|1h|3h30|42h30|43h30|
|Gregory|2h|0h|46h|48h|

- The absent hours has already been taken in consideration on the project time.
- I just add the overtime to the project time to have the total project time.




## Lessons Learned
- Do not only do what you have to do but help other on their task to have a good product.
- Never always count on AI and try to do some research
- Having a good vibe in a team is very important.



## Conclusion
This project was overall a good one, even with some complication, we manage to deliver a product and keep track of everything we have done.
We learned a lot about method of work, orgaization , and as a first time having the role "project manager", I saw my mistakes and will be a better one in the future.
