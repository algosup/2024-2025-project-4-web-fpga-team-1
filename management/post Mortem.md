| **Team Member**      | **Mad**                                                                                                           | **Glad**                                                                            | **Overview by the Team**                                                                                                                                                                           |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Alexis SANTOS**    | After finishing my functional document, I didn’t know what to do and just waited for Lucas’s task to help.        | Happy to have delivered my functional document on time.                              | Works a lot and is the type of person we want on a team. However, he may take on too much responsibility, given the importance of his role in the project.                                      |
| **Loïc NOGUES**      | I didn’t know what tasks to assign to Alexis once he finished his main task.                                      | First-time manager and happy to deliver something that, while not perfect, is solid. | Not an experienced manager, but a good balance between seriousness and a relaxed approach. Focused on his role but didn’t engage in other tasks like coding. Asked questions about his position.   |
| **Grégory PAGNOUX**  | /                                                                                                                 | Happy with the work I delivered.                                                     | A dedicated worker, but tends to stay in his own bubble. He has his own methods and always finds tasks to work on.                                                                                   |
| **Lucas MEGNAN**     | I didn’t complete what I needed to and asked for help too late.                                                  | We had some good ideas, though not all were implemented.                             | Completed his work, contributing to a tangible result. Brings good energy but can be grumpy at times. Relied on Yann-Maël for AI-generated code rather than researching independently. Tends to speak negatively about others and interrupt conversations due to ego.  |
| **Yann-Maël BOUTON** | Frustrated about not contributing much to the project due to lack of motivation caused by the project and other factors. | /                                                                                    | A good presence in the team but easily distracted. Sometimes grumpy. Lacked motivation and only worked on his technical tasks.                                                                      |
| **Mathis LEBEL**     | I didn’t contribute much, which could have impacted the team. I wasn’t really interested in the project.          | I did what I needed to do.                                                           | Generally brings good vibes but gets easily distracted. Lacked interest and motivation for the project, leading to inconsistent contributions.                                                       |

## **Lessons Learned**  
- **Collaboration is key:** Don’t just focus on individual tasks—helping teammates leads to a better overall product.  
- **AI is a tool, not a crutch:** Never rely entirely on AI; independent research is crucial.  
- **Team dynamics matter:** Maintaining a positive atmosphere is essential for productivity.

## **Conclusion**  
This project was overall a positive experience. Despite some challenges, we successfully delivered a product while tracking our progress.  

We learned valuable lessons about **work methods, organization, and project management.** As a first-time project manager, I recognized my mistakes and will use this experience to improve in the future.
