# 4.Issues
As always a team member is putting a minimum effort to do his work. This issue is resolved because it is the last week and he will work a lot, he have a lot of review to do and also he have to do is test-cases.
Another issue is a team-member had to restart over a big part of the code because it was not working. This issue can be explained by the fact that he didn't prioritize the requirements of the project and try to make something beatifull and do not concentrate on the things that are important. So he didn't have time so he rush the important part of the project and it was not working. To solve this issue, our PgM helped him. Both of them manage to make it work and now the code function well. It still have some bugs do resolve but the code will meet the deadline.


# 5.Plan For Next Week
Finish the code, finish the user-manual and all the management documentation. We need to review all of that and merge it to the main branch of our github page.
Also the test-cases will be done to next week.
And finally the test-cases will be done too.
