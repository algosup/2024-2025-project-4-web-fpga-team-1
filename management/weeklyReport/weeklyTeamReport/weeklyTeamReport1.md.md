# Summary

-Overall the members of the team like the project. They say it is interesting and unique.
- Some members use AI to do there document and I tell them that they can use it as a tool but not to do all their work
- No major issues encountered.
  
  At the end of this first week, the team manage to advance with their work and if we continue like that, we can manage to finish all the task before or at the deadline.
  
  To conclude, the majority is happy because of their role and the project topic and it was a good 1st week except the lack of project time during this one.
