# Summary
- Overall this week was good even if we didn't have a lot of project time.
- Some people are scared that we don't deliver a good product because of a member not working that much.

In conclusion the week was fine and the majority of the team members are happy with their work. The only problem is that some people are scared and don't know if the product will be good at the end.
