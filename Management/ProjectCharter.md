# Project Overview

This project is made by ALGOSUP's students.The goal of this project is to make a web interface for a FPGA simulator/shematic animator for educational purposes.

# Project Scope

The project scope for developping a web interface. This FPGA simulator will have some key components and functionnalities. The fuctional goes more in detail about all the features.

# Cost

For this project, we are limited to the material we are provided. For the time, we have 70 hours of project time without overtimes.

# Risk

- Time: We have only 6 weeks/70 hours of project time. If we encounter to many issues, we might have not enough time to finish the project. To counter that we will prioritize the tasks according to the Deadlines order.

- Out of scope: This project is complex to understand for some people and we have a risk to be out of scope. To be in the scope, we will ask questions and do meetings with the client do be sure that we are not out of scope.
