            <p>
                This website is focused on helping you teach or learn how the FPGA board system works.
                It combine a realistic 2D representation with a dynamic signal propagation over time.
                The aim is to create an interactive and intuitive platform that allow you to observe and analyze signal propagation.
            </p>
            <p>
                For simplicity, we will represent the FPGA system with different view to understand the FPGA system through animations that symbolize signals transfers.
            </p>
            <p>
                This includes integrating the layout resulting from the synthesis and P&R processes with timing simulation data.
                You can analyze using a test bench and a timing netlist, both written in Verilog.
