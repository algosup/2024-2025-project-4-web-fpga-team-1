# I. Overview

Our client, Florent MANNI has solicited us to develop a web interface for an FPGA Simulator[^1]. This web interface[^3] will be used to teach people how signals propagated inside an FPGA[^2]. For simplicity, we will represent the board with differents views (define in the document) to understand the FPGA system through animations. Those animations mainly symbolize signals transfers. 

## A. Product Description

This web application[^4] is focused on helping Florent MANNI and/or his team to teach to new FPGA users how the system works. The application has to combine a more or less realistic 2D representation of an FPGA with dynamic signal propagation over time. This includes integrating the layout resulting from the synthesis[^5] and placement and routing (P&R)[^6] processes with timing simulation data. The aim is to create an interactive and intuitive platform that allows users to observe and analyze signal propagation using a testbench[^7] and a timing netlist[^8], both written in Verilog[^9].

## B. Product Functional Capabilities

The product, responding to customer demands, should be able to have a lot of functionality.

### Visualization

As a web application, the project must have an interface. This interface should be a 2D View where the user must have the ability to navigate through the view to visualize what happened in the **FPGA system**.

This graphical model should illustrated :
  * An arrangement of basic elements(BELs)[^10],
  * Connections dictated by a Verilog file,

Therefore, the model should reflect the post-synthesis and place-and-route(P&R) design.

However, to understand what happened in this system, every signals must be represented graphically with animations dictated by an SDF (standard delay file). These signals must be: 
  * The propagation of a clock signal
  * The propagation of data

### Examples

An interface or view without content is useless. That's why we have examples. These examples are Verilog files that we can use to provide the views with something to focus on. Thanks to them, we can visualize the basic uses of the FPGA system.

However, these examples couldn't be enough. It is for that why the customer would to have the ability to add other Verilog files to become additional examples.

### Time Control

This web app has an educational goal. Hence, any animation should be able to be manipulate to watch again animations, slow it down, or speed it up. 
To acheive this objective, we should have a button(s) to **resume**, **pause**, and/or **reset** animations.
To manipulate animations' speed, we should have an option to select which speed we want.   

### Compatibility

Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox... A lot of browser exist in the market. As a consequence, our web application should be usable on every web browser existing on the market. 
For that, we should use in the web app only components and styles recognized in each browser. Therefore, the web app should be responsive to different screen sizes.

### Security

**If the web app will be share on the web**, we should implement security measures to protect user data and ensure the integrity of the application.

# II. Requirements

## A. Functional Requirements

This project focuses on creating an **animation** of an FPGA Simulator to explain how an FPGA system works.

### FPGA Simulator

The project is based on an FPGA simulator. This one needs to follow these requirements: 
* A **2D floor** plan with two/three views.
* The ability to see the path taken by signals in the board

However, the client requested two interfaces/main functionalities on this web app: The student interface and the teacher interface.

#### Teacher interface / Backend

The teacher interface is to be used by the teacher for severals reason: 

-  The ability to **add another example** with their own Verilog file.
-  Access to a testbench.

#### Student interface / Frontend

The student interface allows the student to explore and discover FPGA properties and functionalities. However, this view needs to follow these requirements: 

- The 2D view of an FPGA Simulator. 
- Navigation within the view with zoom and move functionalities. 
- Selection of the default example or the teacher's example(s) with associated visualization. 
- A play button to pause or resume the animation.
- A button to select the speed of the animation.

### Three Views

Depending on which example the student uses, he could view one of these views :

#### All Views

In this three views, the user has the following features :

| 2D View & Navigation                                                                                                                              | Time Control                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Example used & Visualization                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <li>Navigate trough the screen with delimitation. </li> <li>Zoom on the screen to see more details or zoom out to view the global schematic.</li> | <li>Pause and resume button to stop or continue the animation.</li> <li>Controller/button to select the speed of the animation with the following choices: <br> <div style='text-align: center;'> 0.5 / 0.75 / 1 / 1.25 / 1.5 / 2 / 4 </div></li> | <li>Choose the exercise between the default example and the example from the file provided by the teacher </li> <li> Depending on the example used by the student, one of the three views defined below will be used.</li> |

To organize the screen, we'll follow the model below. 

<img src='pictures/webAppDisplay.png' style='border: 1px solid black'>

For the next three views, they will displayed on the **display part**.

#### Shematics Representation

<div style='align-items: flex-start; overflow: hidden'>
   <img src='pictures\FPGAShematics.png' style='float: right; margin-left: 20px; max-width: 45%; width: 500px; height: auto; position: relative' alt='picture of a Schematic Representation' >
   <div style='flex: 1'>
   <p>
   The schematic view is a <b>2D diagram</b> representing components such as flip-flops, BRAMs, or LUT4s. The aim of this view is to <b>understand</b> how data and clock signals move through the components and how the program interacts with them from start to finish.

   The movement of data and clock signals is <b>illustrated</b> through animations. For each component, the following information must be displayed:

   <li>The type of component (LUT, BRAM, Clock, etc.)</li>
   <li>The ID of the component (e.g., Q1, Clk, etc.)</li>
   <li>Inputs and outputs</li>
   <br>
   Additionally, the following information must be displayed between components:

   <li>The delay in signal transmission from one component to another</li>
   <li>The type of data being transferred (clock, status, etc.)</li>
   </p>
</div>
<div style='clear: both'></div> 

#### Signals Graph

<div style='align-items: flex-start; overflow: hidden'>
   <img src='pictures\FPGASignals.png' style='float: right; margin-left: 20px; max-width: 45%; width: 500px; height: auto; position: relative' alt='signals graph' >
   <div style='flex: 1'>
   <p>
   FPGAs, like other digital systems, use the <b>binary system</b>. Each component has a binary state or is used to change the binary state. Therefore, it is important to <b>monitor the status</b> of these components. <br> With this view, we should be able to see the clock status and the one of each component. This would be useful for observing how many clock cycles each step of the program takes. With this information, students can better <b>understand</b> why certain events occur.
   </p>
</div>
<div style='clear: both'></div> 

#### FPGA board's Schematic


<div style='align-items: flex-start; overflow: hidden'>
   <img src='pictures\FPGABoardRepresentation.png' alt='picture of a part of the FPGA board' style='float: right; margin-left: 20px; max-width: 45%; width: 500px; height: auto; position: relative' >
   <div style='flex: 1'>
   <p>
   The FPGA board's schematic is a <b>2D floorplan</b> used by the student to understand how the program sends data and clock signals. <br> 
   In this view, the student needs the following features:<br>
   <li>An animation to show these clock and data signals.</li>
   <li>Differents color between data and clock signals to distinguish them.</li>
   <li>Components used by the program would by glowed.</li>

   <br>
   However, in the conception of the schematic, we need to strike the <b>best balance between reality and schematic representation</b> to make it realistic and user-friendly.
   </p>

### Use Cases Analysis

<h4>Start the Web App</h4> 

When we start the Web app, firstly the program check if you are connected. If yes, you look at your last example used. If not, you arrive in a log in/sign up page.

![Start the page](pictures/startThePage.png)

<h4>Switch Example</h4>

A sidebar located in parameter 1 of the model should have a lot of functionalities. One of them is the button `Switch Example`. With it, the user should select one of default examples or the teacher example.

![Select Example](pictures/selectExample.png)

<h4>Animation</h4>

The project's goal is to have an animation to illustrate program action. So, with a `play button`, we should be allowed to pause and resume animation.

![animation](pictures/Animation.png)

<h4>Animation Speed</h4>

Near to the play button, we should have a `drop-down list`. With it, the animation speed up or slow down. We should be allowed to select the speed between this speed values : 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 4. The **default value** is x1.

![Speed Animation](pictures/speedAnimation.png)

## B. Non Functional Requirements

<h4> Input File </h4>

The software should not accept any input except for importing files for another example provided by the teacher. Therefore, the software must filter the data supplied by the teacher.
Accepted entries are: 
* A **schematic netlist** (in Verilog format) => elements to be represented on screen
* A **standard delay file** (SDF format) => signal propagation time between each element

Whole Example should be in a folder `Example`.  

<h4> Compatibility </h4>

The project focuses on creating a web interface. Therefore, this interface should work with every computer (Windows, Linux, MacOS). However, compatibility with mobile devices is not a priority.

# Glossary

[^1]: An FPGA Simulator is a tool that helps designers test digital circuits before they are built. It uses special languages like Verilog or VHDL to simulate how signals move through an FPGA, ensuring everything works correctly.

[^2]: An FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array)  is an integrated circuit with basic elements and preconfigured electrical signal routes between them.

[^3]: A web interface is a user-friendly website or online tool that lets you interact with a system or application through your web browser. It's like a control panel on the internet where you can click buttons, enter information, and see results without needing special software.

[^4]: A web app is like a website that you can interact with, it like an application you can use on your phone, hence instead of use an application store to download it, you use it through a web browser like Chrome or Safari.

[^5]: Translation of the application into an electrical equivalent. It creates a netlist (which can be exported as a netlist). 

[^6]: Place and Route is the packing of the netlist component in the FPGA available BEL (Place). Then a route for signals between each BEL is selected (Route). A timing netlist is created and can be exported in verilog.

[^7]: A testbench is a crucial tool in the design and verification process, helping to ensure that digital circuits and systems function correctly before they are manufactured.

[^8]: A netlist is like a recipe for building an electronic circuit. It tells you what components you need and how to put them together (connections) to create a functioning circuit.

[^9]: Verilog is a language used to program a system using the FPGA layout. It use to writting instruction to the system.

[^10]: These are the hardware electrical ressources available inside the FPGA like fliflop, Look-Up-Table (LUT), Block RAM....

[^11]: HTML, CSS and JavaScript are pagramations languages usually used for the web. It is what we use for this project.  

[^12]: A flip-flop is a tiny switch in circuits that store one bit of data (0 or 1) and helps control when data changes.

[^13]: A LUT4 is a small table that can execute simple logical operations, such as AND, OR or NOT, on up to four inputs.
