                <h1>What is FPGA?</h1>
                <p>
                    A Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is a type of Integrated Circuit (IC) that can be programmed and reconfigured after manufacturing. 
                    Unlike traditional processors (CPUs) or Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which have fixed functions, 
                    an FPGA allows users to customize its hardware functionality according to specific needs. This flexibility makes FPGAs widely used in high-performance computing, 
                    telecommunications, automotive, aerospace, and industrial applications.

                <h3>How Does an FPGA Work?</h3>
                <p>
                    An FPGA features a matrix of Configurable Logic Blocks (CLBs) interconnected through a programmable network, enabling the execution of complex logical functions in parallel. 
                    This parallelism grants FPGAs significant speed and efficiency advantages over conventional processors. Programming is done using Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) 
                    like VHDL or Verilog, defining logic gate configurations and interconnections. This hardware-level customization delivers superior performance for specialized applications compared to software-based solutions.

                <h3>Advantages of FPGAs</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reconfigurability: Can be reprogrammed as needed, allowing hardware updates without changing physical components.</li>
                    <li>Parallel Processing: Executes multiple operations simultaneously, improving speed and efficiency.</li>
                    <li>Low Latency: Performs tasks in real-time with minimal delays, ideal for time-sensitive applications.</li>

                <h1>What is Verilog?</h1>
                <p>
                    Verilog is a HDL used for designing and modeling digital circuits and systems. It allows engineers to describe the structure and behavior of electronic circuits, 
                    particularly for FPGAs and ASICs. Developed in the 1980s and later standardized as IEEE 1364, Verilog has become one of the most widely used languages in digital design, alongside VHDL.

                <h3>Purpose and Applications</h3>
                <p>
                    Verilog enables engineers to design, simulate, and verify digital circuits before manufacturing. Widely used in microprocessor design, signal processing, 
                    memory systems, and embedded systems, it allows for writing Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code to define data flow between registers under clock control. 
                    Verilog also plays a crucial role in design verification through testbenches and simulations. It supports both behavioral modeling, which defines circuit functionality, 
                    and structural modeling, which specifies component interconnections.
