            <p>
                This website is focused on helping you teach or learn how the FPGA board system works.
                It combine a realistic 2D representation with a dynamic signal propagation over time.
                The aim is to create an interactive and intuitive platform that allow you to observe and analyze signal propagation.
            </p>
            <p>
                For simplicity, we will represent the FPGA system with different view to understand the FPGA system through animations that symbolize signals transfers.
            </p>
            <p>
                This includes integrating the layout resulting from the synthesis and P&R processes with timing simulation data.
                You can analyze using a test bench and a timing netlist, both written in Verilog.

                In this case, the 'Licensor' informs the 'Re-user' (by any means) of their presence, and the 'Information' may be freely re-used, 
                without hindering the freedoms granted by this licence, provided that the legal framework relating to the protection of personal data is respected.
            </p>

                When the 'Licensor' holds 'Intellectual Property Rights' on the 'Information', it transfers them to the 'Re-user' on a non-exclusive basis, 
                free of charge, for the whole world, for the whole duration of the 'Intellectual Property Rights', and the 'Re-user' may make any use thereof in accordance with the freedoms and conditions defined by this licence.

                It may also be used by any person wishing to make 'Information' available under the conditions defined by this licence.
                <br>
                France has an overall legal framework aimed at the spontaneous dissemination by public authorities of their public information in order to enable the widest possible re-use.
                <br>
                The right to 'Reuse' government information is governed by the Code des Relations entre le Public et l'Administration (CRPA) and, 
                where applicable, the Code du Patrimoine (Book II on archives).
