# I. Overview

Our client, Florant MANNI ask us to develop a web interface for an FPGA Simulator[^1]. This web interface will be used to teach people how the signals propagate inside an FPGA[^2]. For simplicity, we'll use the schematic of an FPGA board and animate it to show the movement of data and clock in the board.

## A. Purpose of the document

The purpose of this Functional Specification is to outline the requirements and design considerations for developing a web interface for an FPGA Simulator[^1]. This interface aims to provide an educational tool that visually demonstrates how signals propagate within an FPGA, enhancing users' understanding of FPGA behavior.

The document will detail the functionalities needed to merge a 2D floorplan representation of an FPGA with the dynamic propagation of signals over time. This includes integrating the layout resulting from synthesis and place-and-route (P&R) processes with timing simulation data. The goal is to create an interactive and intuitive platform that allows users to observe and analyze signal propagation using a testbench[^3] and timing netlist[^4], both written in Verilog.

By defining the scope, features, and user interactions, this specification will serve as a comprehensive guide for the development team to ensure the final product meets the educational objectives and technical requirements.

## B. Project Scope 

The project scope for developing the web interface[^5] for the FPGA Simulator includes the following key components and functionalities:

1. 2D floorplan Visualization:

   * Develop a graphical representation of the **FPGA layout**, displaying the arrangement of basic elements (BELs) and their interconnections.
   * Ensure the layout accurately **reflects** the post-synthesis and place-and-route (P&R) design.

<br>

2. Signal Propagation Simulation:
   
   * Integrate a timing simulator to **visualize** the propagation of clock signals within the FPGA with an animation.
   * Use a testbench and timing netlist, both written in Verilog, to drive the simulation and **demonstrate signal** behavior over time.

<br>

3. Double Interface:

   * A web interface is used by a student to interact with the webpage to **explore** and **understand** what happens in the system.
   * A backend interface is used by a teacher to give a script to the program to train the student with the web interface.

<br>  

4. Interactive User Interface:

   * Create an **intuitive** web interface that allows users to interact with the FPGA layout and observe signal propagation.
   * Include controls for **starting**, **pausing**, and **resetting** the simulation, as well as options to inspect signal states at specific points in time.

<br>

5. Educational Features:

   * Implement features that enhance learning, such as tooltips, annotations to explain FPGA concepts and signal behavior.
   * Provide options for users to **load different FPGA designs** and testbenches to explore various scenarios.

<br>

6. Technical Requirements:

    * Ensure the web interface is **compatible** with modern **web browsers** and responsive to different screen sizes.
    * Optimize performance to handle complex FPGA designs and real-time signal propagation simulations.
    * **If it share on the web**, implement security measures to protect user data and ensure the integrity of the simulation environment.

<br>

7. Testing and Validation:

   * Conduct thorough testing to validate the accuracy of the signal propagation simulation and the usability of the interface.
   * Gather feedback from users to iteratively improve the educational value and user experience of the tool.

<br>

By focusing on these components, the project aims to deliver a comprehensive and interactive web interface that effectively teaches users about FPGA signal propagation.

# Glossary

[^1]: An FPGA Simulator is a tool that helps designers test digital circuits before they are built. It uses special languages like Verilog or VHDL to mimic how signals move through an FPGA, ensuring everything works correctly.

[^2]: An FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) is a customizable chip that can be programmed to do different tasks. Unlike regular chips that do one thing, an FPGA can change its function, making it versatile for various jobs.

[^3]: A testbench is a crucial tool in the design and verification process, helping to ensure that digital circuits and systems function correctly before they are manufactured.

[^4]: A netlist is like a recipe for building an electronic circuit. It tells you what components you need and how to put them together (connections) to create a functioning circuit.

[^5]: A web interface is a user-friendly website or online tool that lets you interact with a system or application through your web browser. It's like a control panel on the internet where you can click buttons, enter information, and see results without needing special software.
